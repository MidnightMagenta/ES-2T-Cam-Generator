## How to use

Extract the archive into any folder, open ES-2T-gen.exe, specify 

- stroke - engine stroke in milimeters

- Rod length - connecting rod length in milimeters

- Exhaust port height - exhaust port height in millimeters

- Exhaust port offset - exhaust port edge offset from cylinder top in millimeters

- Transfer port height - transfer port height in millimeters

- Transfer port offset - transfer port offset from cylinder bottom in millimeters

- Path - any valid path to any folder on your computer *do not specify the file name, the program names your file automatically*

This is a very rough program, you may report bugs, I will try to fix them, but I do not promise to maintain this program. If there is enough interest, I will post updates to make it more robust, and easier to use.

This software may create and modify files on your system. I have added failsafes to ensure no file is accidentally corrupted, however you should avoid specifying paths that may contain sensitive data
